# Forks

Hi, I'm @orsinium. I created a lot of open source projects. However, now I don't have enough mental power and free time to maintain all of them. I decided to leave only a few active ones and archive everything else.

If you really want an archived project to live:

* Fork the project.
* Attribute the link to the original repository in the README of the fork. It should come before any level two headers. You don't need any other attributions. Feel free to change anything you like, including the license.
* Add link to the fork in this repo.

You can do it for any archived project created by me. The full list of my projects is at [orsinium.dev](https://orsinium.dev/projects.html).

Updated README example:

```markdown
# DepHell

DepHell -- project management for Python.

Fork of (dephell/dephell)[https://github.com/dephell/dephell/]
```

Link template:

```markdown
* [dephell/dephell](https://github.com/dephell/dephell/)
  * [your_name/dephell](https://github.com/your_name/dephell/)
```

Thank you!
